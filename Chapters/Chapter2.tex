\label{sec:REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE}

The reference section is auto-generated based on your references.bib, and are sorted alphabetically. There are two ways to cite in-text, namely:

\subsection{Citing with parencite}

\verb|\parencite{reference label}| is used for in-text citation outside the sentence structure. You can label your references in many ways, but I recommend using the AuthorYear (i.e. Rotman2009) naming convention for a cleaner system \parencite{Rotman2009}. This is how it will look when citing two authors \parencite{booktwoauthors} and three authors \parencite{bookthreeauthors} from a book using \verb|@book|.

To cite from a journal paper, use \verb|@article| \parencite{journalarticleoneauthor}. You can also place multiple labels in one citation call just like this \parencite{journalarticletwoauthors, journalarticlethreeauthors}. To cite a conference paper use \verb|@incollection| \parencite{conferencearticle} and to cite a website use \verb|@misc| \parencite{website}.


\subsection{Citing with textcite}

\verb|\textcite{reference label}| is used for in-text citation within the sentence structure. You can label your references in many ways, but I recommend using the AuthorYear (i.e. Rotman2009) naming convention for a cleaner system, as shown in \textcite{Rotman2009}. This is how it will look when citing two authors \textcite{booktwoauthors} and three authors \textcite{bookthreeauthors} from a book using \verb|@book|.

To cite from a journal paper, use \verb|@article| exemplified in \textcite{journalarticleoneauthor}. You can also place multiple labels in one citation call just like \textcite{journalarticletwoauthors, journalarticlethreeauthors}. To cite a conference paper use \verb|@incollection| from \textcite{conferencearticle}. Furthermore, to cite a website use \verb|@misc| illustrated in \textcite{website}.
